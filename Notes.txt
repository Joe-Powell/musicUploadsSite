Notes in concatenations:

 ## Note echo "<h2>" . $row['title'] . "</h2>";   There is multiple concatinations the  ; ends the echo
 ## Point is, echo " <input type='text' name='id_to_update' value='" . $row['session_id'] . "'> ";      " ends the string, you add a . then . " to  start then next concatenation string

To concatenate into a query remember to use the right characters. notice below the = is followed by ' then "  then .  then the $_GET  then "  then ' then "  then ;
   **  $sql2 = "SELECT * FROM posts JOIN users ON users.uid = posts.session_uid WHERE users.username = '" . $_GET['user'] . " '";

$_GET[ ] 
In the posts there wll be an anchor tag <a href=' '>  that will have a query string  of ?user=username.
 if (!isset($_GET['user']))  all public posts will show, else it will show the $_GET['username'] persons posts only as if it's their prfile
** <a href='./?user=" . $author['username'] . " '>" . $author['username'] . " </a>




CRUD:
*the session_uid gets put into each post so you know which user posted the post, 
then make the while loop, 
add the content,
while still in the while loop, make a conditional statement so edit buttons show only for logged-in user and if the post was published by the logged-in user, 
if (isset($_SESSION['uid']) && $_SESSION['uid'] == $row['session_id']),
 add the buttons for edit, and delete which are just buttons that will trigger the forms below that display:none to display:block , 
 then add the update and delete forms which carry the post id, and fields you will be updating,
