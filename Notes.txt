Notes in concatenations:

 ## Note echo "<h2>" . $row['title'] . "</h2>";   There is multiple concatinations the  ; ends the echo
 ## Point is, echo " <input type='text' name='id_to_update' value='" . $row['session_id'] . "'> ";      " ends the string, you add a . then . " to  start then next concatenation string

CRUD:
*the session_uid gets put into each post so you know which user posted the post, 
then make the while loop, 
add the content,
while still in the while loop, make a conditional statement so edit buttons show only for logged-in user and if the post was published by the logged-in user, 
if (isset($_SESSION['uid']) && $_SESSION['uid'] == $row['session_id']),
 add the buttons for edit, and delete which are just buttons that will trigger the forms below that display:none to display:block , 
 then add the update and delete forms which carry the post id, and fields you will be updating,
